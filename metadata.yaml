description: <DIV>Although the short stories in this collection take place in the
  distant future and within fictional landscapes, the themes that James Gunn examines
  are the perpetual issues of the human race. These stories revolve around the testing
  of man's true character-a problem that Gunn, through his powerful plot construction,
  proves to be universal.</DIV>
